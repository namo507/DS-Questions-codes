## How would you construct a feed to show relevant content for a site that involves user interactions with items?

The Three Pillars Approach
I'd construct the feed using a balanced three-pillar framework that guides users to relevant content:

1. User Affinity Map üß≤ (User ka behaviour)
Explicit signals: What they've liked, saved, commented on
Implicit patterns: Dwell time, click behavior, scroll patterns
Collaborative insights: What similar (mutual friends wagera jo bhi) users engage with.

2. Content DNA Analysis üß¨ (In depth ab topic ka dekhenge )
Item characteristics: Topic, format, recency, quality metrics
Interaction history: How users typically engage with this content
Popularity gradient: Rising vs. stable vs. declining interest

3. Discovery Dynamics üîç
Controlled serendipity: Introducing new-but-related content
Diversity metrics: Preventing echo chambers and content fatigue
Contextual relevance: Time of day, device, user situation
