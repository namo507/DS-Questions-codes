Suggesting Where to Open a New Store: The Gym Expansion Plan
Imagine you’re a gym chain planning your next location.

Scout the Neighborhood: Look for areas with lots of fitness enthusiasts but few gyms (high demand, low competition).

Check Member Density: Analyze where your current members live—clusters may signal underserved areas.

Study Traffic Flow: Like checking when the gym is busiest, use foot traffic and demographic data to find hotspots.

Competitor Recon: Avoid opening next to another gym unless you offer something unique.

Test with Pop-Ups: Try a temporary class or event to gauge local interest before committing.
In short:

Open your next store where the “workout crowd” is eager, competition is light, and your unique offerings fill a gap.
