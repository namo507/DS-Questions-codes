## In a search engine, given partial data on what the user has typed, how would you predict the user’s eventual search query?

Picture a coach who finishes your sentences as you describe a workout:

Past Routines: The coach remembers what you usually ask for (historical search data).

Popular Moves: Suggests trending exercises (popular queries).
Auto-Completion: As you say “bench…,” the coach guesses “bench press” or “bench dips” (autocomplete using n-grams or language models).

Personalization: If you love yoga, the coach suggests “bench yoga stretches” (personalized suggestions).

In short:
Predict the user’s search by combining their habits, popular trends, and context—just like a coach who knows your next move.
