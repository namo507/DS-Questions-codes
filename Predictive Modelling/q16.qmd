## Given a database of all previous alumni donations to your university, how would you predict which recent alumni are most likely to donate?

Think of alumni as gym members:

Track Attendance: Who attended events or stayed active (engagement signals)?

Past Purchases: Who bought merch or renewed memberships (previous donations)?

Personal Milestones: Members celebrating anniversaries or achievements may be more likely to give (life events).

Peer Influence: If their workout buddies donate, they might too (social proof).

In short:
Spot likely donors by finding engaged, loyal, and socially connected “members” who’ve shown generosity before.
