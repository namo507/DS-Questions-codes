## How would you build a model to predict a March Mad-ness bracket?

Building a bracket is like picking a fantasy gym team:

Analyze Stats: Review each athlete’s performance (team stats, win/loss records).

Spot Upsets: Look for underdogs with hidden strengths (historical upsets).

Simulate Matches: Run “practice games” to see likely outcomes (Monte Carlo simulations).

Adjust for Injuries: Factor in recent injuries or changes (latest news).

In short:
Combine stats, simulations, and surprises to build a winning bracket—like assembling a dream team for a gym competition.
