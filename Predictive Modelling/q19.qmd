## You want to run a regression to predict the probability of a flight delay, but there are flights with delays of up to 12 hours that are really messing up your model. How can you address this?

Some gym members lift way more than others—these outliers can skew your stats:

Cap the Max: Set a limit on how much weight counts (cap extreme delays).

Log Transform: Use a scale that shrinks big numbers (log transformation).

Robust Models: Choose models less sensitive to outliers (robust regression).

Separate Analysis: Treat extreme cases as a special group (model separately).

In short:
Don’t let a few “super-lifters” distort your view—adjust your analysis to focus on the typical gym crowd (flights).
