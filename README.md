# Data Science Interview Preparation | Questions & Code Solutions

Welcome to my comprehensive data science interview preparation repository! This collection brings together curated interview questions, practical coding solutions, and hands-on predictive modeling exercises designed to help build confidence and expertise for data science technical interviews.

## What's Inside This Repository

This repository is organized into focused sections that cover different aspects of data science interviews, from theoretical concepts to hands-on coding challenges. Each section contains detailed solutions and implementations to help you understand not just the answers, but the reasoning and approach behind them.

### DS Interview Preparation

The DS Interview folder contains a structured 3-day interview prep series covering fundamental data science concepts, statistics, machine learning algorithms, and practical problem-solving approaches:

* **Day 1** (Day1.qmd): Foundation topics and essential concepts
* **Day 2** (Day2.qmd): Intermediate techniques and applications
* **Day 3** (Day 3.qmd): Advanced topics and interview strategies

These files are written in Quarto markdown format, combining explanations with executable code examples to demonstrate key concepts in action.

### Predictive Modelling Practice

The Predictive Modelling folder is packed with 19+ hands-on modeling challenges (q1 through q19) that walk through real-world scenarios you might encounter in technical interviews:

**Question Sets**
* q1.qmd through q19.qmd: Individual predictive modeling problems with complete solutions
* q2.qmd: Additional modeling exercise
* q3.ipynb: Jupyter notebook implementation
* q4.qmd through q9.qmd: Extended problem sets

Each question file contains:
* Problem statement and context
* Data exploration and preprocessing steps
* Model building and evaluation
* Code implementation with detailed comments
* Performance analysis and interpretation

These exercises cover a wide range of modeling techniques including regression, classification, time series forecasting, ensemble methods, and more.

### Learning Resources

**Interview Question Bank**
* 120 real data science interview questions (Carl Shan, Max Song, Henry Wang etc.) (Z-Library).pdf

This comprehensive PDF resource contains authentic interview questions compiled from real data science interviews at top tech companies. It covers questions across statistics, machine learning, programming, product sense, and behavioral topics.

**Data Structures & Algorithms Roadmap**
* DSA Roadmap problem.qmd

A structured guide to essential data structures and algorithms concepts with coding implementations. This roadmap helps you systematically prepare for coding portions of data science interviews.

**Programming & Implementation**
* Python for data science
* Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
* Scikit-learn for machine learning
* Data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn
* Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis
* Quarto for reproducible documentation

**Predictive Modeling**
* Linear and logistic regression
* Decision trees and random forests
* Gradient boosting methods
* Neural networks and deep learning basics

## How to Use This Repository

**For Structured Learning:**
Start with the DS Interview folder and work through Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3 sequentially to build a strong foundation.

**For Hands-On Practice:**
Jump into the Predictive Modelling folder and work through individual questions. Each question is self-contained, so you can practice specific types of problems.

**For Interview Prep:**
Review the 120 real interview questions PDF to familiarize yourself with the types of questions asked in actual interviews, then use the code examples in this repository to practice your responses.

**For Algorithm Review:**
Work through the DSA Roadmap problem file to strengthen your understanding of data structures and algorithms commonly tested in interviews.

## File Formats

This repository uses two primary formats for maximum flexibility:

* **.qmd files** (Quarto Markdown): Combine narrative text with executable code, perfect for learning and documentation
* **.ipynb files** (Jupyter Notebooks): Interactive notebooks for hands-on coding and experimentation

Both formats can be opened in JupyterLab, VS Code, or RStudio, making it easy to run and modify the code.

## Repository Purpose

This collection represents my personal journey preparing for data science interviews. I've compiled these resources to create a comprehensive study guide that covers both the theoretical knowledge and practical coding skills needed to succeed in data science technical interviews. Whether you're just starting your interview prep or looking to sharpen specific skills, this repository provides structured materials to guide your learning.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Install necessary Python packages (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
3. Open the .qmd files in your preferred editor or convert them to notebooks
4. Work through the materials at your own pace
5. Practice coding solutions independently before checking the implementations

Good luck with your data science interview preparation!
