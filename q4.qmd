## What are some differences you would expect in a model that minimizes squared error, versus a model that min-imizes absolute error? In which cases would each error metric be appropriate?

1. Model Characteristics

Squared Error Models (e.g., OLS regression):
More sensitive to outliers as errors are squared, giving larger weight to large deviations
Computationally convenient (differentiable everywhere)
Statistically efficient when errors are normally distributed
Tends to produce parameter estimates with lower variance
Solutions typically have closed-form expressions


Absolute Error Models (e.g., LAD/median regression):
More robust to outliers as errors scale linearly
Computationally more challenging (non-differentiable at zero)
Produces the median prediction (versus mean for squared error)
Often requires iterative solution methods
Parameter estimates may have higher variance but lower bias in the presence of outliers



Predicted Values
MEANN   Squared error minimization estimates the conditional (mean) of the target variable.

MEDIAN  Absolute error minimization estimates the conditional (median) of the target variable.


Distribution of Residuals

Squared error assumes errors follow a normal distribution

Absolute error assumes errors follow a Laplace (double exponential) distribution



When to Use Each Error Metric
Use Squared Error When:
Data has few or no outliers
You want to penalize large errors more heavily
Your data approximately follows a normal distribution
You need a differentiable loss function (for gradient-based optimization)
The mean is an appropriate central tendency measure for your problem
You care about overall model stability and prediction variance
Use Absolute Error When:
Data contains significant outliers that you don't want to overly influence the model
You want errors to scale linearly with their magnitude
Your data follows a more peaked distribution than normal
The median is a more appropriate central tendency measure for your problem
You're interested in minimizing the total absolute deviation
You want more robust predictions in noisy environments
Examples of Appropriate Applications
Squared Error Applications:

Linear regression for well-behaved data
Financial forecasting where both positive and negative errors are equally important but large errors are very costly
Scientific modeling where theoretical foundations suggest normal error distributions
Absolute Error Applications:

Real estate price prediction where a few very unusual properties shouldn't skew the model
Time series forecasting in the presence of occasional spikes or anomalies
Financial applications where the magnitude of error matters linearly
Scenarios where median predictions are more useful than mean predictions
In practice, it's often valuable to try both approaches and evaluate which performs better on your specific dataset and problem definition.
