## What are various ways to predict a binary response variable? Can you compare two of them and tell me when one would be more appropriate? Whatâ€™s the difference between these? (SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, etc.)

Common Binary Classification Methods

* Logistic Regression: Uses a logistic function to model probability of class membership
* Support Vector Machines (SVM): Finds the optimal hyperplane that maximizes margin between classes
* Naive Bayes: Applies Bayes theorem with independence assumptions between features
* Decision Trees: Creates a tree-like model of decisions based on feature values
* Random Forests: Ensemble of decision trees with bootstrapped samples and random feature selection
* Gradient Boosting: Sequential ensemble method that builds new models to correct errors of existing ones
* Neural Networks: Connected nodes with weights learned through backpropagation
