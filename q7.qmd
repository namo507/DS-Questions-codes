## What  is  regularization  and  where  might  it  be  helpful?  What is an example of using regularization in a model?

What Is Regularization?
Regularization is like putting your model on a diet â€“ restricting it from becoming too complex by adding a penalty for weight gain. It's mathematically adding a cost to your model's complexity in the loss function.

Where It's Helpful
* When your model is memorizing training data (food) instead of learning patterns (overfitting)
* With high-dimensional data where many features might be noise
* When you have more features than observations
* In transfer learning when adapting pre-trained models


Types of Regularization
* L1/Lasso: The feature eliminator (creates ***sparse models*** by setting some weights to zero) Lassoing Lassi to zero
* L2/Ridge: The weight shrinker (reduces all weights proportionally but rarely to zero) Proportional bridge master
* Elastic Net: The hybrid approach (combines L1 and L2)
* Dropout: The neural network's randomized test (temporarily disables neurons during training)
