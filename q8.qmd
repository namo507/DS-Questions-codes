## Why might it be preferable to include fewer predictors over many?

The Simplicity Advantage
Using fewer predictors is like traveling with a (cabin mein lejaane ke liye bag) carry-on instead of checked luggage - you move faster, worry less about what might get lost, and focus on what's truly essential.

Model Parsimony : Meaning simplicity;

Clear stories, what drives these predictions, easier to implement

Occam's razor: meaning simple explaination is the best
avoids overfittig yaani noise ki jageh dhang se ab signal ko understand karega.

reduces the multicolliniarity problems meaning(correlated predictors)

ab cost bhi lower and faster training and prediction time with data collection ki kam dikkat and easier to maintain and debug

so because of this we can focus more upon the imoportant factors and focus on fundamental relationships rather than coincedental patterns and creare more robust model across different datasets.

Think of it as precision surgery versus carpet bombing - targeted intervention with key predictors often outperforms throwing everything possible at the problem.

The real art in data science isn't including everything you can, but knowing what you can leave out while preserving predictive power.
