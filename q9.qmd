## Given  training  data  on  tweets  and  their  retweets,  how  would you predict the number of retweets of a given tweet after 7 days after only observing 2 days worth of data?

We will be using the two stage approach for this.

This problem requires predicting the future trajectory of retweets with limited early data - similar to forecasting a hurricane's path after observing just its initial formation.

1) Pattern Recognition

I'd first analyze how tweets typically accumulate retweets over time:

* Extract temporal signatures from historical data

Map the 2-day to 7-day retweet ratio patterns
Identify characteristic growth curves (exponential, logarithmic, etc.)
Classify tweets into "growth pattern clusters" based on early behavior

2) Engineer predictive features

Velocity metrics: Rate of retweets in hours 0-24 vs. hours 24-48
Acceleration: Is the rate increasing or decreasing by day 2?
Content factors: Hashtags, media attachments, author influence
Network effects: Initial spread pattern (concentrated vs. distributed)


Now onto the predictive modelling

* Growth pattern classifier that predicts which trajectory type the tweet will follow

"Flash-in-the-pan" (quick burst, rapid decay)
"Slow burner" (gradual, sustained growth)
"Sleeper hit" (initial slow period, then acceleration)
"Viral potential" (showing early exponential growth signs)

Specialized regression models for each pattern type to estimate day 7 totals

The key innovation is recognizing that tweet popularity follows distinct patterns rather than treating all tweets with the same model. This allows for more accurate **extrapolation** from limited early data.

This approach combines time series analysis techniques with classification to create a robust prediction system that can adapt to different viral dynamics.
